## Damage Detective - Generative AI House Inspection Application

**Project description:** 
Problem Statement:
The traditional house inspection process can be burdensome and time-consuming, often resulting in significant costs for homeowners. Inspired by personal experiences, our team set out to revolutionize this process and make it more efficient and accessible to all.

Solution:
Our application leverages cutting-edge technology, including a visual question and answering generative model provided by Archetype AI. This powerful model analyzes images or videos of potential house defects, providing detailed descriptions along with repair costs and consequences of neglect. We optimized our queries based on sentiment analysis and response to visual correlation to ensure accurate and prompt responses.

Features:
Personalization: Users can customize their queries to extract additional information from the Generative Model, making the experience enriching and customizable.
Comprehensive Solutions: Our application offers comprehensive solutions and valuable advice tailored to the best protection/maintenance recommendations based on the condition of the house.
Future Enhancements: With additional time and resources, we plan to develop an Image2Image generative model utilizing Stable Diffusion technology. This advanced model will enable users to visualize before and after scenarios of repairs, enhancing decision-making processes and overall satisfaction.
Conclusion:
Hacklytics 2024 aims to simplify and streamline the house inspection process, saving homeowners time, money, and hassle. Our commitment to innovation and continuous improvement drives us to deliver cutting-edge solutions that benefit everyone.

### 1. The problem DamageDetective solves

Our primary goal is to revolutionize the costly and time-consuming process of house inspections surrounding insurance claims. Inspired by a personal experience where one of our team members endured a laborious inspection process costing hundreds, we embarked on creating a solution. Our innovative application transforms this ordeal into a seamless, nearly instantaneous experience. Leveraging cutting-edge technology, we've leveraged a state-of-the-art visual question and answering generative model provided by Archetype AI. This powerful model analyzes images or videos of potential house defects, providing detailed descriptions of the issues along with repair costs and consequences of neglect. We evaluated the prompt response of the model and optimized our queries to get the best relative response based on the sentiment analysis and response to visual correlation where different types of damages are described differently and as accurately as possible. After optimization of the prompt, we implemented the advanced llama-2 model, concatenating the initial Archetype responses as a basis for predicting potential future damages while offering comprehensive solutions and valuable advice tailored to the best protection/maintenance recommendations based on the condition of the house.

Moreover, our application boasts an open-ended design, allowing users to customize their queries. Users can easily append their own queries to extract additional information from the Generative Model, making the experience even more enriching and customizable.
